## Developing

### Setup

When you first clone this repository, run:

```sh
lein setup
```

This will create files for local configuration, and prep your system
for the project.

### Environment

To begin developing, start with a REPL.

```sh
lein repl
```

Run `go` to initiate and start the system.

```clojure
user=> (go)
:started
```

By default this creates a web server at <http://localhost:3000>.

When you make changes to your source files, use `reset` to reload any
modified files and reset the server.

```clojure
user=> (reset)
:reloading (...)
:resumed
```

### Testing

Testing is fastest through the REPL, as you avoid environment startup
time.

```clojure
user=> (test)
...
```

But you can also run tests through Leiningen.

```sh
lein test
```

### Generators

This project has several [generators][] to help you create files.

* `lein gen endpoint <name>` to create a new endpoint
* `lein gen component <name>` to create a new component

## Deploying

## 12-Factor Apps!
http://12factor.net/

In the modern era, software is commonly delivered as a service: called web apps, or software-as-a-service. The twelve-factor app is a methodology for building software-as-a-service apps that:

* Use declarative formats for setup automation, to minimize time and cost for new developers joining the project;
* Have a clean contract with the underlying operating system, offering maximum portability between execution environments;
* Are suitable for deployment on modern cloud platforms, obviating the need for servers and systems administration;
* Minimize divergence between development and production, enabling continuous deployment for maximum agility;
* And can scale up without significant changes to tooling, architecture, or development practices.

The twelve-factor methodology can be applied to apps written in any programming language, and which use any combination of backing services (database, queue, memory cache, etc).
